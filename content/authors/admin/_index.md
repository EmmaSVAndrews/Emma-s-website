I am a molecular biologist and biochemist with interests in RNA degrading enzymes and enyzme evolution. I received my BSc, MSc and PhD from the University of Waikato. My PhD with Professor Vic Arcus, looked at characterising the biology and biochemistry of PhoH2 proteins from mycobacteria. As a postdoc in Vic's lab, I continued my PhoH2 work and branched into the use of Ancestral Protein Reconstruction as both a tool to study evolution and as a tool for protein engineering. These projects with have sparked my interest in the biological function and multifaceted nature of multi-complex molecular machines that regulate nucleic acid metabolism within the cell. I am intrigued by the evolution, function and the complex mechanics of these enzymes. Through my collaboration with Dr Tolun and colleagues at the University of Wollongong, I have gained insight into the application of mass spectrometry and Cryo Electron Microscopy as powerful techniques for the study of and visualisation of proteins and protein complexes. I have recently joined the MME lab here at Victoria and I am involved with an enzyme evolution and biosensor project. My roles on these projects are to take ancestral proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and build up a functional ancestral pathway in vitro, and on the biosensor project, develop, though the exchange protein domains of a published system, a biosensor that senses metabolites relevant to viticulturists.
