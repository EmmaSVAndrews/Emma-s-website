Emma is a molecular biologist and biochemist with interests in RNA degrading enzymes and enyzme evolution. She received my BSc, MSc and PhD from the University of Waikato. Her PhD with Professor Vic Arcus, characterised the biology and biochemistry of PhoH2 proteins from mycobacteria. As a postdoc in Vic's lab, she continued her work with PhoH2 and branched into the use of Ancestral Protein Reconstruction as both a tool to study evolution and as a tool for protein engineering. These projects with have sparked her interest in the biological function and multifaceted nature of multi-complex molecular machines that regulate nucleic acid metabolism within the cell. She is intrigued by the evolution, function and the complex mechanics of these enzymes. Through her collaboration with Dr Tolun and colleagues at the University of Wollongong, Australia, she has gained insight into the application of mass spectrometry and cryo Electron Microscopy as powerful techniques for the study of and visualisation of proteins and protein complexes. She recently joined Associate Professor Wayne Patrick's lab at Victoria University of Wellington and is involved with an enzyme evolution and biosensor project. Her roles on these projects are to take ancestral proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and build up a functional ancestral pathway in vitro, and on the biosensor project, develop, though the exchange protein domains of a published system, a biosensor that senses metabolites relevant to viticulturists.
Emma also has keen interests in early career researcher development and as such founded the Wellington Postdoctoral Society for postdocs based at Victoria.
